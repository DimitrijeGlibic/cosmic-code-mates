# ðŸŒŒ Cosmic Code Mates



> Discover your dev twin through mutual GitHub stars â€” personalized, AI-powered social feed for developers.

## âœ¨ What is this?

**Cosmic Code Mates** is a lightweight, social experience built on top of the GitHub API and OpenAI.

Just enter your GitHub Personal Access Token with `read:user` and `public_repo` scopes â€” your token is stored **locally only** and never sent anywhere.  
Youâ€™ll get a feed of developers who star the same repositories as you, each paired with a short AI-generated description or poem.



> Think: GitHub meets your cosmic developer horoscope.

## Project info

This was one of those **"what if this existed?"** ideas that I just had to build.  
I vibe-coded most of it using [Lovable](https://lovable.so/) â€” shoutout to their AI builder, it helped me sketch things out fast.

If youâ€™re into the idea and want to help build this into something cool, **PRs and contributions are more than welcome**.  
Even feedback or feature ideas are appreciated â€” just open an issue.
